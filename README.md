## Prerequisites

Before setting up this integration, you need to get credentials by creating an Integration in Trello's Power-Up Admin Portal.

Before installing, you'll need:

1. A Trello account
2. Trello API credentials (API Key and Token)
3. Home Assistant 2023.1 or later

## Getting Trello API Credentials

### Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. **Log into Trello** at [trello.com](https://trello.com)
2. **Visit the Developer API Keys page**: https://trello.com/app-key
3. **Copy your API Key** - this will be your `api_key` in Home Assistant

### Step 2: Generate an API Token

1. **On the same page**, click the **"Token"** link next to "You can manually generate a Token"
2. **Or visit directly**: https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&scope=read,write&response_type=token&key=YOUR_API_KEY
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key from Step 1
3. **Click "Allow"** to grant permissions
4. **Copy the token** - this will be your `api_token` in Home Assistant

### Step 3: Find Your Board IDs

You'll need the Board ID for each board you want to monitor:

1. **Open a Trello board** in your browser
2. **Look at the URL**: `https://trello.com/b/BOARD_ID/board-name`
3. **Copy the BOARD_ID** part (e.g., `5f4d2e1a3b8c7d9f`)
4. **Repeat for all boards** you want to monitor

**Alternative method using Trello API:**
```bash
curl "https://api.trello.com/1/members/me/boards?key=YOUR_API_KEY&token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

### Via configuration.yaml (Legacy)

```yaml
# Not recommended - use UI configuration instead
sensor:
  - platform: trello
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    api_token: YOUR_API_TOKEN
    board_ids:
      - "5f4d2e1a3b8c7d9f"  # Board 1
      - "6g5e3f2b4c9d8e1a"  # Board 2
```

## Available Sensors

After configuration, you'll get sensors for each board:

- `sensor.trello_board_[board_name]` - Main board sensor with all data
- Rich attributes include:
  - Board information (name, description, url)
  - All lists with cards
  - Card details (name, description, due date, labels, members)
  - Statistics (total cards, cards per list)

## Services

The integration provides powerful services for card management:

### `trello.move_card`
Move a card to a different list.

```yaml
service: trello.move_card
data:
  card_id: "5f4d2e1a3b8c7d9f"
  target_list_id: "6g5e3f2b4c9d8e1a"
```

### `trello.create_card`
Create a new card in a list.

```yaml
service: trello.create_card
data:
  list_id: "6g5e3f2b4c9d8e1a"
  name: "New Task"
  description: "Task description here"
```

### `trello.update_card`
Update a card's name and description.

```yaml
service: trello.update_card
data:
  card_id: "5f4d2e1a3b8c7d9f"
  name: "Updated Task Name"
  description: "Updated description"
```

## Example Automations

### Notify when high-priority cards are due

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Trello: High Priority Due Soon"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "09:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: >
          {% set cards = state_attr('sensor.trello_board_project_board', 'cards') %}
          {{ cards | selectattr('labels', 'search', 'Priority: High') 
                   | selectattr('due_date', 'defined') 
                   | list | length > 0 }}
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_iphone
        data:
          title: "High Priority Cards Due"
          message: "You have high priority cards due today!"
```

### Auto-move completed cards

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Trello: Move Completed Cards"
    trigger:
      - platform: webhook
        webhook_id: trello_webhook
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ 'card' in trigger.json.action.type }}"
    action:
      - service: trello.move_card
        data:
          card_id: "{{ trigger.json.action.data.card.id }}"
          target_list_id: "{{ states('input_text.done_list_id') }}"
```

## Authentication Details

The integration uses **Trello's API Key + Token authentication method**, which is:

- ‚úÖ **Officially supported** by Atlassian/Trello
- ‚úÖ **Simple and reliable** - no complex OAuth flows
- ‚úÖ **Secure** - tokens can be revoked anytime
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for Home Assistant** - no callback URLs needed

**Note**: Trello does not support OAuth 2.0. The available options are API Key + Token (recommended) or OAuth 1.0a (more complex).

## Rate Limits

Trello API has the following rate limits:
- **300 requests per 10 seconds** per API key
- **100 requests per 10 seconds** per token

The integration respects these limits with intelligent caching and efficient API usage.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid API key or token"**
- Verify your API key and token are correct
- Make sure the token has read/write permissions
- Check if the token has expired (use `expiration=never`)

**"Board not found"**
- Verify the board ID is correct
- Make sure you have access to the board
- Check if the board is archived

**"Integration not loading"**
- Check Home Assistant logs for errors
- Restart Home Assistant after installation
- Verify all board IDs are valid

### Enable Debug Logging

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.trello: debug
    trello: debug
```

## Visual Board Card

For the complete Trello experience, install the companion [Trello Board Card](https://github.com/SebastianZ84/ha-trello-card):
